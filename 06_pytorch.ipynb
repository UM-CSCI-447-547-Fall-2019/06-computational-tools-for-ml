    "# Topic 6: Tools of the trade\n",
    "## 1 Learning on computational graphs\n",
    "So far, we've been able to build and train neural networks using code that we've developed ourselves, from scratch, using only numpy to handle some vectorized linear algebra.  In particular, the structure of the neural networks that we've looked at (namely the multilayer perceptron) meant that there existed a relatively simple closed form solution for the gradient of a loss function with respect to the network's parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, coming up with (and especially coding) the loss function gradients as our models become more complex becomes tedious, if not also a little bit difficult in some cases: the large chains of derivatives that emerge from application of the chain rule to multiple compositions of vectorized functions tend to be a lot to keep track of for meer mortals.  However, despite the complexity of this process to a human, it's very easy for a computer to keep track of these derivatives, given two specific assumptions:\n",
    "- the computer knows a closed form derivative for every function applied (for example, if a computer sees a logistic function, it needs to know the derivative of that function with respect to its argument)\n",
    "- the computer knows the complete chain of operations between the thing that we want to take the gradient of (the loss function) and the thing that we want to take the gradient with respect to (some parameter in a neural network).  Stated alternatively, the computer needs to have complete knowledge of the *computational graph*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these conditions are met, then for any variables connected by a path in the computational graph, then we can algorithmically differentiate by evaluating the chain rule over every path between variables and taking the resulting sum (over all paths connecting the two variables).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of system is actually not too arduous to code, but it *is* arduous to code in a way that is extremely general (we need to manually define the symbolic derivative of any function that might be used!) and in a way that is efficient enough to be used with the massive amounts of data that have come to define machine learning.  In particular, the creation of a graph computation system that can run on graphical processing units (GPUs), which are very well-suited for computing sequential tensorial operations, is pretty tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we are in the midst of a bit of a machine learning renaissance.  In particular, since 2015 we've had become available multiple computing packages that perform exactly the tasks described above.  Rather than reinvent the wheel, we (and essentially all other machine learning practitioners and researchers) are going to leverage the availability of these products to rapidly produce models that would have been considered state of the art advances just 5 or 10 years ago.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Tools\n",
    "[There are several packages that we might consider using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep-learning_software).  However, for one reason or another, the vast majority of users have converged on two tools, which are both free and open-source, but which are each supported by a FAANG company.  These two tools are [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/)(supported by Google and frequently used via its high-level API Keras) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)(supported by Facebook).  Both have a Python API, and are superb packages.  They differ in their computational strategies (although they are both converging towards something similar), but both can be used to create and differentiate complex neural networks and train those networks in parallel on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, this course has been taught using TensorFlow.  However, due to some recent major changes to how TensorFlow works, and the resulting abundance of deprecated documentation, it has become a bit of a challenge to get going.  This time around, we are going to use PyTorch.  (Note that there are other compelling reasons to use PyTorch: its syntax is widely though to be more intuitive and easier to debug, closely mirrors Numpy and is a bit easier to install. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing pytorch is easy.  Just go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select appropriate installation mechanism for your system (I used pip).  If you have a GPU and would like to use it, be sure that you have either CUDA 9.2 or 10 [installed on your system](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Defining a model in PyTorch\n",
    "Let's see if we can reproduce our multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer from Notebook 5.  We'll begin by importing torch, a helper submodule called torch.nn (which gives us convenient syntax to define *layers*), and the set of differentiable functions available to us, contained in torch.nn.functional."

In this case, we'll use one called [Adam](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/), which is itself builds on another optimizer called RMSProp (which automatically adapts the learning rate based on whether the gradient changes sign) by adding something called *momentum*.
